# Stress-OT-Comp-Phon
Stress Optimality Theory scripts to be used with the Phonology software OTSoft.

## stressot-makeinput.py
A Python adaptation of the original Perl code written by Juliet Stanton (NYU).
Takes user-given constraints to generate a list of stress inputs, then evaluates their feature constraint values. Outputs a txt file of this data that is formatted to be used as the input to OTSoft (http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/otsoft/). Meant to be used in full OT analyses on surface representations of stress in words.
